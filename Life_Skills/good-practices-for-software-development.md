Always over-communicate
We recommend tracking your time using app like Boosted to improve productivity.
Some companies use tools like Trello, Jira for documentation. But if your team is not using any such tool, you should write down the requirements and share it with the team. This will help you get immediate feedback. Also, this will serve as a reference for future conversations

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
Be available when someone replies to your message.--

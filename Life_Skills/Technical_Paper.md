# Full Text Search: Investigating Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene

In our project, we are exploring alternative databases for full-text search to improve performance and scalability. After analyzing the system, we investigate three prominent technologies: **Elasticsearch**, **Solr**, and **Lucene**.

## Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database capable of addressing many use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

## Solr
Solr is highly reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication, load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration, and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites. 

## Apache Lucene
The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software. The project releases a core search library, Lucene core, and PyLucene, a Python binding for Lucene. 

## Conclusion
Elasticsearch fits best for our project. It is highly scalable and fast. According to [DB-Engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BMongoDB) Elasticsearch has been ranked number one since 2016.
